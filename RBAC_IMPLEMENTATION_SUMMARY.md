# PersonaMap RBAC Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Core Models**
- ✅ `Organisation` - Top-level entity grouping users and websites
- ✅ `Website` - Contains crawl jobs, personas, and content mappings  
- ✅ `UserOrganisationRole` - User roles within organisations
- ✅ `UserWebsiteRole` - User roles for specific websites
- ✅ Updated `User` model with RBAC methods and `is_super_admin` flag
- ✅ Updated `CrawlJob` and `Persona` models with `website_id` foreign keys

### 2. **Permission System**
- ✅ Comprehensive permission decorators (`@super_admin_required`, `@website_access_required`, etc.)
- ✅ Permission helper functions (`get_user_accessible_websites()`, `can_manage_website()`, etc.)
- ✅ Role-based access control with inheritance (org admins can manage websites)
- ✅ Backward compatibility with legacy permission system

### 3. **Migration System**
- ✅ Complete migration script (`migrations/add_rbac_system.py`)
- ✅ Automatic migration during `flask init-db`
- ✅ Default organisation and website creation for existing data
- ✅ User migration with appropriate role assignments

### 4. **Management Routes**
- ✅ Organisation management (`/organisations/`)
- ✅ Website management (`/websites/`)
- ✅ User assignment and role management
- ✅ API endpoints for programmatic access

### 5. **CLI Commands**
- ✅ `flask create-super-admin` - Create super admin users
- ✅ `flask create-organisation` - Create new organisations
- ✅ `flask create-website` - Create new websites
- ✅ `flask add-user-to-org` - Assign users to organisations
- ✅ `flask list-users` - View all users and their roles
- ✅ `flask migrate-rbac` - Run RBAC migration only

### 6. **Templates**
- ✅ Organisation list and detail templates
- ✅ Basic website management templates
- ✅ Role-based UI controls

### 7. **Documentation**
- ✅ Comprehensive RBAC guide (`RBAC_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ Implementation examples (`RBAC_EXAMPLES.py`)
- ✅ Permission matrix and usage patterns

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Super Admin (global access)
├── Organisation A
│   ├── User 1 (org_admin)
│   ├── User 2 (website_manager)  
│   └── Websites
│       ├── Website X
│       │   ├── Crawl Jobs
│       │   ├── Personas
│       │   └── Content Mappings
│       └── Website Y
└── Organisation B
    ├── User 3 (website_viewer)
    └── Websites
        └── Website X (shared)
```

## 🔑 Role Hierarchy

1. **Super Admin** - Global access to everything
2. **Organisation Admin** - Full control within their organisation(s)
3. **Website Manager** - Manage specific websites they're assigned to
4. **Website Viewer** - Read-only access to assigned websites

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Initialize the System
```bash
export FLASK_APP=run.py
flask init-db  # This now includes RBAC migration
```

### 2. Create Your Structure
```bash
# Create an organisation
flask create-organisation
# Name: "My Company"

# Create a website  
flask create-website
# Name: "Company Website"
# Domain: "company.com"

# Add user to organisation
flask add-user-to-org
# Username: "john"
# Organisation ID: 1
# Role: "org_admin"
```

### 3. Access Management
- Navigate to `/organisations` to manage organisations
- Navigate to `/websites` to manage websites
- Users will only see content they have access to

### 4. In Your Code
```python
from app.auth.permissions import website_access_required, get_user_accessible_crawl_jobs

# Protect routes
@bp.route('/crawl-jobs/<int:id>')
@login_required
@crawl_job_access_required(crawl_job_id_param='id')
def view_crawl_job(id):
    # Permission already verified
    pass

# Filter data
@bp.route('/dashboard')  
@login_required
def dashboard():
    crawl_jobs = get_user_accessible_crawl_jobs()
    return render_template('dashboard.html', crawl_jobs=crawl_jobs)
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

The system is designed for **zero-downtime migration**:

1. **Existing users** → Moved to "Default Organisation" with appropriate roles
2. **Existing crawl jobs** → Assigned to "Default Website"  
3. **Existing personas** → Assigned to "Default Website"
4. **Legacy permissions** → Still work for backward compatibility
5. **Admin users** → Automatically become super admins

## ⚡ Quick Start Example

```bash
# 1. Run migration
export FLASK_APP=run.py
flask init-db

# 2. Create your organization structure
flask create-organisation
# Enter: "Acme Corp"

flask create-website  
# Enter: "Acme Website", "acme.com"

# 3. Add a user to the organisation
flask add-user-to-org
# Enter: "admin", "1", "org_admin"

# 4. Start the app
python run.py

# 5. Login and navigate to /organisations
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ **Data isolation** - Users only see their authorized content
- ✅ **Permission inheritance** - Org admins automatically manage org websites
- ✅ **Decorator-based protection** - Routes protected with simple decorators
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - Existing permissions still work
- ✅ **Audit trail** - Created/updated timestamps on all role assignments

## 🔍 Testing the Implementation

### As Super Admin
- Can see all organisations, websites, crawl jobs, personas
- Can create/edit/delete everything
- Can assign users to organisations and websites

### As Organisation Admin  
- Can see only their organisation(s)
- Can manage users within their organisation
- Can manage all websites assigned to their organisation
- Can create/edit crawl jobs and personas for their websites

### As Website Manager
- Can see only assigned websites
- Can manage crawl jobs and personas for assigned websites
- Can view but not edit organisation settings

### As Website Viewer
- Can see assigned websites (read-only)
- Can view crawl jobs, personas, and reports
- Cannot create or edit anything

## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Update existing routes** to use new permission system
2. **Update templates** to show role-based controls
3. **Test thoroughly** with different user roles
4. **Deploy migration** to production environment

The foundation is now in place for a comprehensive role-based access control system!
